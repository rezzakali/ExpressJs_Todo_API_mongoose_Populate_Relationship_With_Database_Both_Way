In this project I'm trying to make a Todo API using Express.js (Node.js) and I use mongoDB as a database and use mongoose for object data modeling. In here I'm also try
to protect the router where user can register there account and after registered the user can login with the token_access id which is generated by jsonwebtoken (use json
webtoken as to create the token id for most secure) and finally the user is fully accessed for routing. In this project I'm also check (function named checkLogin) the
user is loged in or not. In this project I'm getting the biggest problem when I'm trying to make the many-to-one relationship with the user to todo collection,and after
a few minutes I'm useally solved the problem and finally created this project. Thanks
